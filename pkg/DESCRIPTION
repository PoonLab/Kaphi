Description: Kaphi is a package for phylodynamic using approximate Bayesian computation 
 (ABC).  It uses a kernel method to compare the shapes of phylogenies, which is the 
 basis for parameter rejection in the context of ABC.  Kaphi implements an adaptive
 sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that was formulated by del Moral and colleagues:
